System Architecture Summary

1. Configuration & Setup
- Environment variables (.env) store RPC URL, DEX addresses, token pairs, and profit thresholds.
- config.rs loads these parameters for use across the system.

2. Data Sources & Connectivity
- rpc.rs connects to the Polygon blockchain via RPC.
- dex.rs provides DEX contract addresses.
- price.rs fetches real-time token prices from DEXs using web3.

3. Arbitrage Opportunity Detection
- main.rs compares token prices across multiple DEXs.
	a. Main orchestrates the entire workflow:
	b. Receives token prices from Price.rs.
	c. Detects potential arbitrage opportunities.
	d. Passes opportunities to arbitrage.rs for evaluation.

- Sends profitable opportunities (Profit) to profit.rs.

4. Opportunity Simulation
- arbitrage.rs simulates trades to check feasibility.
- Calculates estimated profits while accounting for gas costs.

5. Profit Validation & Storage
- profit.rs verifies profitable results.
- db.rs records successful opportunities into a database for future analysis.

6. Overall Workflow
Config → Connect → Fetch Prices → Detect Opportunities → Simulate Trades → Validate Profit → Store Results
