# blockchain_project
A bot in Rust that detects potential arbitrage opportunities on the Polygon network. Arbitrage, in this context, means finding a situation where a specific token (e.g., USDC, ETH, BTC or any other token) can be bought cheaply on one Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and immediately sold for a higher price on another DEX.
